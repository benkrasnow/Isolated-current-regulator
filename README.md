# Isolated-current-regulator
Small linear current regulator powered by a 9V battery

Designed to provide a constant 8mA with up to 100V drop.  This circuit is adjustable from 0 to 100mA, and will quickly become thermally limited.  The transistor can hold back 400V, so the circuit could be operated at 2mA at 350V and still be within thermal limits of about 1 or 2W.
